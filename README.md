# Wizard Assistant
*To make wizard work easier.*

This app is intended to work as API server between [Flash Wizard](https://github.com/gerwant/flash-wizard) and file storage server.<br/><br/>
It provides endpoints for retrieving info about available devices, configuration and available sensors of each device and also provides direct link to download appropriate firmware file through the client app.
<br/><br/>
Keep in mind that your compilation won't work because ftp credentials aren't stored in the repository.
