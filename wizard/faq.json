            "content": "There are couple of reasons why this error happens. One of them is the lack of bootloader. You can solve that by burning an appropriate bootloader. For example, Anet printers with board version 1.6 and 1.7 need the bootloader burning. If that doesn't help, then your connection with the printer isn't correct. You can check if you chose good COM port or check USB cable or make sure that your printer isn't flashed with custom bootloader with different baudrate than typical."

However, to make it even easier, we're planning to implement an automatic bootloader burning with exact instructions how to connect the printer to burn it right.We're happy to announce that v0.2 version of Flash Wizard will have such a feature."
